Data
====

This is a repository for various data sets. Data sets are of varying nature; some are real-world data sets, others are simulated data sets, and others are somewhere in between.

Where necessary, one can find additional context for the data in sub-directory README markdown files. This context may be beneficial where data has unique peculiarities or obtained under special circumstances, e.g., data was produced under laboratory conditions and concerns a particular sample. 

Should you find use for these data sets, the one request you are asked to provide in return is to contact me about what you find or how you put them to use. You may do so at kgryte(at)gmail(dot)com.
