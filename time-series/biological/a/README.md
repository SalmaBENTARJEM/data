Protein Dynamics
===

These directories contain time series data for individual protein molecules structurally fluctuating in real-time. Each directory contains data for a separate unique condition for a common protein of interest. 

For more information concerning the unique nature of the data, data acquisition, and any peculiarities, consult references documenting single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). At the current time, no resources are easily found freely on the web explaining the concept well for those outside the field. (Alas, scientists are not the best at public relations!) One brief overview is provided by a group at the <a href="http://bio.physics.illinois.edu/newTechnique.html" target="_blank">University of Illinois</a>. If your instutition has an academic license for science journals, your attempts to find quality resources will be easier.
